Info:

This program is intended to easily Enable, Disable and View the status of Madden 08 Mods. 
The program reads the list of mods from a *.ini file that can be found in the same directory
as the .exe. This not only ensures no other files get touched but it allows for the addition
of mods in the future. The enabling of the mods is simply done by Symlinking to the "Mods" folder.
To disable it, it just unlinks the mods returning the "Madden NFL 08" folder to its original state.
To check the status of the mods, the program scans for the first & last mod in the "Madden NFL 08" folder.
